    Create update modal for customer
    
    I started by first setting up the UI and setting up the jquery to start
    modal from my controller ts code. After setting up the modal I used
    reactive form to setup the form and for validation. I created an api to
    recive the put request and update the selected customer record.

    Show customer detail
    
    On the /customer page show the success modal when the view button is
    clicked.
    
    After executing the command npm install -D @types/jquery add the following
    code to the ts file of the customer-main.component.ts file [declare var
    jquery: any;] and [declare var $: any;]. Now you can write any jqury type
    of jquery code. To open the modal use the following snippet
    [$("modal-view").modal("show").] use a separate global variable to hold
    the currently selected modal to view, edit and delete the record.
